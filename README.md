# ADEL_APP Project - 2024
# Smart Traffic Signal Control System
## A Brief Description
In this Project we have designed a smart traffic signal control system which automatically detects traffic jam and decides which lane should be opened.

If there is no traffic jam in any lane, the system sequentially keeps open one lane one after another. But if there is traffic jam in one or more lanes, the system serves the lane in which traffic jam occured first.

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **I'm looking for collaborators who are passionate about: - **Traffic Management Systems**: Developers, engineers, or urban planners who are interested in optimizing and improving traffic flow using smart technologies. - **Machine Learning & AI**: Experts in AI who can help improve the real-time detection and analysis of vehicle data. - **IoT and Smart Cities**: Innovators working on IoT and smart infrastructure solutions that align with Vision 2030 and the concept of sustainable cities. - **Open-Source Enthusiasts**: Contributors who want to help with code development, testing, and documentation.**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Feel free to reach out and ask me about: - **Smart Traffic Systems**: How the system works, its architecture, and how it can be integrated with existing infrastructure. - **Traffic Optimization Algorithms**: The logic behind vehicle prioritization and dynamic signal timing. - **Vision 2030**: How this project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and contributes to smart city initiatives. - **Contributing to the Project**: How you can get involved, collaborate, or contribute new features or improvements.**

## Problems Faced
1. The ATmega32 has 3 timers. We have used timer1 for the sonar while timer0 for determining the time duration a vehicle remains stand still. That's why we have to use one microcontroller for each lane of any road. This leads to increased number of microcontrollers
2. The systems performs badly if two or more lanes become jam packed. In that case, the system serves only the jam packed roads while the other roads remains unserved.

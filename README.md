## Traffic Solution Using Computer Vision (ÿπÿßÿØŸêŸÑ)
### Optimizing Traffic Flow through Intelligent Signal Management

This project implements a **Smart Traffic Signal System** that optimizes traffic flow based on real-time vehicle density at intersections. The system uses computer vision to detect and classify vehicles, dynamically adjusting signal timings based on the number and type of vehicles present.

---

## üöó Key Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Density Measurement**: Continuously detects the number of vehicles at each traffic signal.
- **Weighted Vehicle Prioritization**: Assigns different weights to vehicles (small cars vs. trucks).
- **Dynamic Signal Timing**: Adjusts the green light duration based on vehicle density and types.
- **Traffic Violation Detection**: Monitors illegal lane changes and signals violations.

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-traffic-signal-system.git
   cd smart-traffic-signal-system
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py


üîç How It Works
Vehicle Detection and Classification
The system uses computer vision to detect vehicles and classify them into two categories:

Small cars: Given a weight of 1
Large trucks: Given a weight of 2
Based on the weights, the signal time is adjusted dynamically to reduce congestion.

Code Snippet: Vehicle Detection and Signal Timing
## Problems Faced
1. The ATmega32 has 3 timers. We have used timer1 for the sonar while timer0 for determining the time duration a vehicle remains stand still. That's why we have to use one microcontroller for each lane of any road. This leads to increased number of microcontrollers
2. The systems performs badly if two or more lanes become jam packed. In that case, the system serves only the jam packed roads while the other roads remains unserved.
## ü§ñ Future Enhancements
Integration with Autonomous Vehicles: Communicate directly with smart vehicles to optimize traffic flow further.
Enhanced Traffic Violation Detection: Add more sophisticated violation detection features such as speed monitoring and red-light running.
Cloud Integration: Store real-time traffic data on the cloud for long-term analysis and improvements.

## Key Features

- *Vehicle Detection*: YOLOv8 detects vehicles in real time with high accuracy, categorizing vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes.
- *License Plate Recognition*: PaddleOCR is used for detecting and reading license plates, ensuring that violators are properly identified.
- *Traffic Signal Optimization*: The system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timing based on vehicle density at intersections, improving traffic flow.
- *Violation Detection*: Smart cameras monitor lane-crossing violations, with automatic notifications sent to violators, reducing manual law enforcement efforts.

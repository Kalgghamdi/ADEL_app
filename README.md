# ADEL_APP Project - 2024
# Traffic Solution Using Computer Vision (ÿπÿßÿØŸêŸÑ)
## **Optimizing Traffic Flow through Intelligent Signal Management**

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at developing a **Smart Traffic Signal System** that optimizes the flow of traffic based on real-time vehicle density at intersections. The system dynamically adjusts signal priorities to give more time to the direction with higher vehicle density. By assigning vehicles a default weight based on their type (e.g., cars, trucks), the system allocates signal time in a way that balances traffic efficiency.

For example:
- **Small cars** are given a weight of 1.
- **Large trucks** are assigned a weight of 2.

This allows for a more realistic distribution of signal time, ensuring that both light and heavy vehicles are accounted for. If an intersection has a total signal time of 2 minutes, the system will allocate 20 seconds for each signal, adjusting based on traffic conditions to optimize flow.

## Key Features
- **Real-time vehicle density measurement**: Detects the number of vehicles at each signal.
- **Weighted vehicle prioritization**: Adjusts signal time based on vehicle type (e.g., small cars vs. large trucks).
- **Dynamic signal timing**: Allocates more time to directions with higher traffic, reducing congestion and wait time.

## Vision 2030 Alignment
This project supports **Saudi Vision 2030**, which seeks to enhance urban infrastructure and improve the quality of life through the integration of smart technologies. By improving traffic flow, the **Smart Traffic Signal System** helps in:
- Reducing traffic congestion.
- Lowering carbon emissions.
- Enhancing the daily commuting experience.

The system also contributes to the development of **smart cities** that use intelligent solutions to manage resources efficiently, aligning with the broader goals of Vision 2030.

## Benefits
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces wait times at intersections, improving overall traffic flow.
- **Environmental Impact**: Lower idle times at signals can contribute to reduced fuel consumption and emissions.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for use in cities with different traffic patterns and densities.
- **Flexibility**: Signal timings can be easily modified based on changes in traffic behavior, ensuring long-term effectiveness.

## Getting Started
To set up the project on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-traffic-signal-system.git

## Problems Faced
1. The ATmega32 has 3 timers. We have used timer1 for the sonar while timer0 for determining the time duration a vehicle remains stand still. That's why we have to use one microcontroller for each lane of any road. This leads to increased number of microcontrollers
2. The systems performs badly if two or more lanes become jam packed. In that case, the system serves only the jam packed roads while the other roads remains unserved.
